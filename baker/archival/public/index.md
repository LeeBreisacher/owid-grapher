This domain hosts archived versions of [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) charts.

Links you encounter on this domain are officially maintained by Our World in Data, and are copies of a chart that are frozen in time at a specific point in history, as noted in the URL and the page header.
Their functionality will not change, and they will not be updated with new data.
If you are looking for the latest version of a chart, please visit [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/).

The charts being frozen in time makes them suitable for use in academic publications, as they can be cited with a specific date and URL.
They are also well-suited for use as embeds in other websites, as they will look the same in the future as they do today.
